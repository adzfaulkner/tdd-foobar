TDD Foo Bar
===========

This repo was developed during a TDD workshop that my current client hosted.

The task was to create an application that printed out:

* "Foo" on a number that was divisible by 3
* "Bar" on a number that was divisble by 5
* "FooBar" on a number that was divisible by 3 and 5
* For any other number simply print it out as it was

My immediate task was to build the test and generate the expected dataset generated by a date provider. Once this was accomplished, define the stub methods in a class and run the tests. As expected the test failed, then I started writing the production code and running the tests in an iteractive loop until my test(s) passed.

I demonstrated the code to the workshop leader who seemed impressed before modifying the requirements to:

* "Foo" on a number that was divisible by 3
* "Bar" on a number that was divisble by 5
* "FooBar" on a number that was divisible by 3 or 5 and numbers that contained a 3
* For any other number simply print it out as it was

My production code was quickly going to produce a scent of code smell as a result of this. I had to think of a more robust solution. Then it hit me, let's implement the Chain of Responsibility patten and the rest is history.
